**Flight Panel** is config screen library that tries to combine the flexibility of [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and the design elements of [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) while adding something of its own on top.

It supports both screen builders and object-to-screen transformations.
